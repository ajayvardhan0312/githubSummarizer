# githubSummarizer
Github Summarizer is a Chrome extension developed using Flask-powered backend that automatically summarizes any public GitHub repository using OpenAI’s GPT models.

Why This Project?
For many small or mid-sized repositories, finding proper documentation or a comprehensive README can be a challenge.
This extension automatically analyzes code structure and logic to generate a summary and explanation for developers, saving hours of manual exploration.
